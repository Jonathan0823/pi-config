# Generic /plan

Use the full text after `/plan` as the request.

## Workflow

1. Read the request literally.
2. If it is empty or too vague, ask 1-3 short clarifying questions focused on:
   - goal
   - scope
   - constraints / edge cases
3. If the request is still unclear after that, give a brief usage example and stop.
4. If it is clear enough, gather only the minimum extra context needed before planning:
   - inspect the relevant files, docs, or nearby code if a workspace is present
   - check existing patterns, tests, and constraints
   - do not rely on taskflow, task files, or repository-specific planning state
5. Make sure you can restate the goal and scope confidently before drafting the plan.
6. Return a plain-text draft plan only. Do not WRITE files or make changes. Keep it short, readable, and actionable.
